## Group 17 Project

To run this project, create a local environment in anaconda using the **requirements.txt** file.
You also need **ffmpeg** installed on your system, if you need to convert your audio files to .wav format.

For more info, check out the [GitHub for WhisperX](https://github.com/m-bain/whisperX).

For the text to avatar part, it should be run on colab. Run 'TextToAvatar.ipynb'. It will take 'trancript.txt' as input, which is the output from the precious step. The notebook will output 'final_video_enhanced_cap.mp4' as our avatar video.
